According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Framework for Implementing a Custom Sign-in Page in SharePoint: 1. Development Environment Preparation: Ensure Visual Studio is installed with SharePoint development tools | Backup SharePoint environment | 2. Creating the Custom Sign-in Page: 2.1. Start a new Project: Launch Visual Studio, Create new ASP.NET Web Application | 2.2.

Deploy using Visual Studio: Right-click project, Click Deploy |".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " C#"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  C#. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To implement the custom sign-in page in SharePoint using C#, we will need to create several files and implement the necessary logic. Here is the file structure and code for each file:

1. CustomLogin.aspx
This file will contain the HTML markup for the login form.

```aspx
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="CustomLogin.aspx.cs" Inherits="CustomLoginPage.CustomLogin" %>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Custom Login</title>

        </div>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

2. CustomLogin.aspx.cs
This file will contain the code-behind logic for the custom login page.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;

namespace CustomLoginPage
{
    public partial class CustomLogin : Page
    {
        protected void LoginButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)

            string username = username.Text;
            string password = password.Text;

            // Implement authentication logic here
            bool isAuthenticated = AuthenticateUser(username, password);

            if (isAuthenticated)
            {
                // Redirect to SharePoint page
                Response.Redirect("https://your-sharepoint-site.com");

        {
            // Implement authentication against Active Directory or provider
            // Return true if authentication is successful, false otherwise
            // Example:

            //     return false;
            // }
        }
    }
}
```

3. Elements.xml

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The AuthenticateUser method in the CustomLogin.aspx.cs file is not implemented. It is missing the logic to authenticate the user against Active Directory or a provider. This will prevent the login functionality from working correctly. 

<SUGGESTION> To fix this, you need to implement the AuthenticateUser method by adding the necessary code to authenticate the user. You can use the provided example as a starting point and replace it with the actual authentication logic. Make sure to return true if the authentication is successful and false otherwise.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary using statements to import the required namespaces. This can lead to compilation errors. 

To fix this, add the following using statements at the top of the CustomLogin.aspx.cs file:

```csharp
using System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement;

This will import the necessary namespace for the AccountManagement class, which is used for authentication against Active Directory.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary using statements to import the required namespaces. This can lead to compilation errors. 

To fix this, add the following using statements at the top of the CustomLogin.aspx.cs file:

```csharp
using System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement;
```

This will import the necessary namespace for the AccountManagement class, which is used for authentication against Active Directory."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary using statements for the referenced classes. Specifically, the following using statements should be added at the top of the CustomLogin.aspx.cs file:

```csharp
using System.DirectoryServices;
using System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement;
```

These using statements are required for the PrincipalContext and ContextType classes used in the AuthenticateUser method.

To fix this issue, add the missing using statements at the top of the CustomLogin.aspx.cs file.

Once you have made the necessary changes, please retest the code to ensure it compiles and functions as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary using statements for the referenced classes. Specifically, the following using statements should be added at the top of the CustomLogin.aspx.cs file:

```csharp
using System.DirectoryServices;
using System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement;
```

These using statements are required for the PrincipalContext and ContextType classes used in the AuthenticateUser method.

To fix this issue, add the missing using statements at the top of the CustomLogin.aspx.cs file.

Once you have made the necessary changes, please retest the code to ensure it compiles and functions as expected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Development Environment Preparation: Ensure Visual Studio is installed with SharePoint development tools | Backup SharePoint environment | 2. Creating the Custom Sign-in Page: 2.1. Start a new Project: Launch Visual Studio, Create new ASP.NET Web Application | 2.2. Design the Login Form: Add Web Form (CustomLogin.aspx), Include TextBox controls for username & password, Add Button for login | 2.3. Implement Authentication Logic: In CustomLogin.aspx.cs, validate user against AD/provider, On successful validation, redirect to SharePoint page | 3. Deploying to SharePoint: 3.1. Package for SharePoint: Add Module e.g., CustomLoginPageModule, Remove default items, Include CustomLogin.aspx, Update Elements.xml to deploy to _layouts | 3.2. Deploy using Visual Studio: Right-click project, Click Deploy |.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Since the provided codes and file format are related to SharePoint development using C#, it seems that you are looking for a requirements.txt file for a Python project. However, requirements.txt files are typically used in Python projects to specify Python package dependencies, not SharePoint development dependencies.

In SharePoint development, you typically rely on SharePoint-specific libraries and tools rather than Python packages. Therefore, a requirements.txt file is not applicable in this context.

To develop a custom sign-in page in SharePoint using the provided instructions, you need to ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio with SharePoint development tools installed.
2. A SharePoint environment to test and deploy the custom sign-in page.

These are the essential requirements for SharePoint development, and you should already have them in place based on the task instructions.

If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with SharePoint development, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help.

To complete the task of implementing a custom sign-in page in SharePoint, we need to focus on the provided instructions and ensure that we have the necessary tools and environment set up. Let's review the instructions and determine the next steps:

1. Development Environment Preparation:
   - Ensure Visual Studio is installed with SharePoint development tools.
   - Backup SharePoint environment.

2. Creating the Custom Sign-in Page:
   2.1. Start a new Project:
   - Launch Visual Studio.
   - Create a new ASP.NET Web Application.

   2.2. Design the Login Form:
   - Add a Web Form (CustomLogin.aspx).
   - Include TextBox controls for username and password.
   - Add a Button for login.

   2.3. Implement Authentication Logic:
   - In CustomLogin.aspx.cs, validate the user against AD/provider.
   - On successful validation, redirect to the SharePoint page.

3. Deploying to SharePoint:
   3.1. Package for SharePoint:
   - Add a Module, e.g., CustomLoginPageModule.
   - Remove default items.
   - Include CustomLogin.aspx.
   - Update Elements.xml to deploy to _layouts.

   3.2. Deploy using Visual Studio:
   - Right-click the project.
   - Click Deploy.

Based on these instructions, we need to ensure that Visual Studio is installed with SharePoint development tools. Additionally, we should have a backup of the SharePoint environment before making any changes.

Once the development environment is prepared, we can follow the instructions to create the custom sign-in page by starting a new ASP.NET Web Application in Visual Studio and designing the login form with the required controls.

Next, we need to implement the authentication logic in the code-behind file (CustomLogin.aspx.cs) to validate the user against the Active Directory or provider. On successful validation, we can redirect the user to the SharePoint page.

After implementing the custom sign-in page, we need to package it for SharePoint deployment. This involves adding a module (CustomLoginPageModule), removing default items, including the CustomLogin.aspx file, and updating the Elements.xml file to deploy to the _layouts directory.

Finally, we can deploy the solution to SharePoint by right-clicking the project in Visual Studio and selecting the Deploy option.

Let's ensure that we have the necessary tools and environment set up, and then we can proceed with implementing the custom sign-in page in SharePoint.

# Framework for Implementing a Custom Sign-in Page in SharePoint

This manual provides a step-by-step guide on how to implement a custom sign-in page in SharePoint using Visual Studio and ASP.NET. The custom sign-in page allows users to authenticate against Active Directory or a provider and redirect them to the SharePoint page upon successful validation.

## Table of Contents

1. [Development Environment Preparation](#development-environment-preparation)
2. [Creating the Custom Sign-in Page](#creating-the-custom-sign-in-page)
3. [Implementing Authentication Logic](#implementing-authentication-logic)
4. [Deploying to SharePoint](#deploying-to-sharepoint)

## Development Environment Preparation

Before starting the implementation, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Visual Studio installed with SharePoint development tools
- Backup of the SharePoint environment

## Creating the Custom Sign-in Page

To create the custom sign-in page, follow these steps:

1. Launch Visual Studio.
2. Create a new ASP.NET Web Application project.
3. Design the login form by adding a web form (CustomLogin.aspx).
4. Include TextBox controls for username and password.
5. Add a Button for login.

## Implementing Authentication Logic

To implement the authentication logic, follow these steps:

1. Open the code-behind file for the CustomLogin.aspx page (CustomLogin.aspx.cs).
2. In the LoginButton_Click event handler, validate the user against Active Directory or the provider.
3. If the validation is successful, redirect the user to the SharePoint page.
4. If the validation fails, display an error message.

Here is an example code snippet for the authentication logic:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement;

namespace CustomLoginPage
{
    public partial class CustomLogin : Page
    {
        protected void LoginButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            string username = Username.Text;
            string password = Password.Text;

            // Implement authentication logic here
            bool isAuthenticated = AuthenticateUser(username, password);

            if (isAuthenticated)
            {
                // Redirect to SharePoint page
                Response.Redirect("https://your-sharepoint-site.com");
            }
            else
            {
                // Display error message
                Response.Write("Invalid username or password");
            }
        }

        private bool AuthenticateUser(string username, string password)
        {
            // Implement authentication against Active Directory or provider
            // Return true if authentication is successful, false otherwise
            // Example:
            using (var context = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain))
            {
                return context.ValidateCredentials(username, password);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Deploying to SharePoint

To deploy the custom sign-in page to SharePoint, follow these steps:

1. Add a module (e.g., CustomLoginPageModule) to the SharePoint package.
2. Remove default items from the module.
3. Include the CustomLogin.aspx file in the module.
4. Update the Elements.xml file to deploy the CustomLogin.aspx file to the _layouts folder.
5. Right-click on the project in Visual Studio and click Deploy.

Here is an example code snippet for the Elements.xml file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Elements xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/sharepoint/">
  <Module Name="CustomLoginPageModule" Url="_layouts">
    <File Path="CustomLoginPageModule\CustomLogin.aspx" Url="CustomLogin.aspx" Type="GhostableInLibrary" IgnoreIfAlreadyExists="TRUE" />
  </Module>
</Elements>
```

That's it! You have successfully implemented a custom sign-in page in SharePoint. Users will now be able to authenticate using the custom login form and be redirected to the SharePoint page upon successful validation.

Please let us know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

            }
        }
