To develop a custom sign-in page for SharePoint 2019 on-premise, we will create a C# application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Windows Forms. The application will detect external access and adjust the authentication process to prevent repetitive login prompts. Here is the proposed file structure and code implementation:

1. Main File - Program.cs

```C#
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace SharePointSignInPage
{
    static class Program
    {
        [STAThread]
        static void Main()
        {
            Application.EnableVisualStyles();
            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
            Application.Run(new SignInForm());
        }
    }
}
```

2. SignInForm.cs

```C#
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace SharePointSignInPage
{
    public partial class SignInForm : Form
    {
        public SignInForm()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void SignInForm_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Perform any initialization tasks
        }

        private void btnSignIn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Handle sign-in button click event

This is a basic implementation of a custom sign-in page for SharePoint 2019 on-premise using C# and Windows Forms. You can further enhance the code by adding additional features, such as password encryption, error handling, and integration with SharePoint APIs for seamless authentication.

Please note that this is just a starting point, and you may need to modify the code based on your specific requirements and SharePoint configuration.

[2023-24-10 15:29:32 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To develop a custom sign-in page for SharePoint 2019 on-premise, we will create a C# application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Windows Forms. The application will detect external access and adjust the authentication process to prevent repetitive login prompts. Here is the proposed file structure and code implementation:

1. Main File - Program.cs

```C#
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace SharePointSignInPage
{
    static class Program
    {
        [STAThread]
        static void Main()
        {
            Application.EnableVisualStyles();
            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
            Application.Run(new SignInForm());
        }
    }
}
```

2. SignInForm.cs

```C#
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace SharePointSignInPage
{
    public partial class SignInForm : Form
    {
        public SignInForm()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void SignInForm_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Perform any initialization tasks
        }

        private void btnSignIn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Handle sign-in button click event
            string username = txtUsername.Text;
            string password = txtPassword.Text;

            // Perform authentication and redirect to SharePoint if successful
            if (AuthenticateUser(username, password))
            {
                // Redirect to SharePoint
                MessageBox.Show("Successfully signed in to SharePoint!");
                // TODO: Add code to redirect to SharePoint
            }
            else
            {
                MessageBox.Show("Invalid username or password. Please try again.");
            }
        }

        private bool AuthenticateUser(string username, string password)
        {
            // TODO: Implement authentication logic
            // Example: Check against a database or external authentication service
            // Return true if authentication is successful, false otherwise
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

3. SignInForm.Designer.cs

```C#
namespace SharePointSignInPage
{
    partial class SignInForm
    {
        // Auto-generated code for form design
        // Omitted for brevity

}
```

The codes provided are missing some important implementation details and have a few potential issues. Here is my comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision:

Comment: The AuthenticateUser method is currently returning false, indicating unsuccessful authentication, regardless of the input. This will prevent any successful sign-ins. 

Suggestion: To fix this issue, you need to implement the authentication logic in the AuthenticateUser method. You can check the provided username and password against a database or an external authentication service. If the authentication is successful, return true; otherwise, return false.

Additionally, here are a few other suggestions to improve the code:

1. Import necessary namespaces: Make sure to import the required namespaces at the top of each file. For example, in the Program.cs file, you need to import the System.Windows.Forms namespace.

2. Handle form initialization: In the SignInForm_Load method, you can perform any necessary initialization tasks, such as setting default values or loading data.

3. Implement redirection to SharePoint: In the btnSignIn_Click method, after successful authentication, you need to add code to redirect the user to the SharePoint site. You can use the Process.Start method to open the SharePoint URL in the default web browser.

4. Add error handling: It's important to handle any potential errors that may occur during the authentication process. You can use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions appropriately.

Once you have made the necessary revisions based on these suggestions, please provide the updated code for further review.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided is for a Windows Forms application, but the task requires developing a custom sign-in page for SharePoint 2019 on-premise. To meet the requirements, the code needs to be modified to work with SharePoint and provide a web-based sign-in page.

<SUGGESTION>
1. Create a new ASP.NET web application project in Visual Studio.
2. Add a new web form for the sign-in page.
3. Implement the necessary HTML and CSS to create the sign-in page layout.
4. Add server-side code to handle the sign-in button click event and perform authentication.
5. Use SharePoint's authentication APIs or external authentication services to authenticate the user.
6. If authentication is successful, redirect the user to the SharePoint site.
7. If authentication fails, display an error message on the sign-in page.
8. Ensure that the sign-in page is secure by using appropriate security measures like SSL/TLS.
9. Test the sign-in page with external logins to ensure it gracefully handles external access and prevents repetitive login prompts.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or have any questions."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the authentication logic in the `AuthenticateUser` method. This method should check the provided username and password against a database or an external authentication service. Currently, it only checks for a hardcoded username and password, which is not secure and not suitable for a production environment.

<SUGGESTION> To fix this issue, you need to implement the authentication logic in the `AuthenticateUser` method. You can use a secure authentication mechanism, such as hashing the passwords and comparing them with the stored hashed passwords in a database. Additionally, you may need to integrate with an external authentication service, such as Active Directory or OAuth, to authenticate users against an external system.

Once you have implemented the authentication logic, make sure to update the `btnSignIn_Click` method to use the `AuthenticateUser` method correctly and handle the authentication result accordingly.

Comments on Codes:
The code is missing the implementation of the authentication logic in the `AuthenticateUser` method. This method should check the provided username and password against a database or an external authentication service. Currently, it only checks for a hardcoded username and password, which is not secure and not suitable for a production environment.

To fix this issue, you need to implement the authentication logic in the `AuthenticateUser` method. You can use a secure authentication mechanism, such as hashing the passwords and comparing them with the stored hashed passwords in a database. Additionally, you may need to integrate with an external authentication service, such as Active Directory or OAuth, to authenticate users against an external system.

Once you have implemented the authentication logic, make sure to update the `btnSignIn_Click` method to use the `AuthenticateUser` method correctly and handle the authentication result accordingly.

Comments on Codes:
The code is missing the implementation of the authentication logic in the `AuthenticateUser` method. This method should check the provided username and password against a database or an external authentication service. Currently, it only checks for a hardcoded username and password, which is not secure and not suitable for a production environment.

To fix this issue, you need to implement the authentication logic in the `AuthenticateUser` method. You can use a secure authentication mechanism, such as hashing the passwords and comparing them with the stored hashed passwords in a database. Additionally, you may need to integrate with an external authentication service, such as Active Directory or OAuth, to authenticate users against an external system.

Once you have implemented the authentication logic, make sure to update the `btnSignIn_Click` method to use the `AuthenticateUser` method correctly and handle the authentication result accordingly.

Since the provided codes are written in C# and the task does not mention any specific Python dependencies, there is no need to create a requirements.txt file for this project. The requirements.txt file is typically used in Python projects to specify the Python packages and their versions required for the project.

However, if you are planning to use any additional Python packages or libraries in your project, you can create a requirements.txt file by following these steps:

1. Open a text editor.
2. Create a new file and save it as "requirements.txt".
3. Specify the Python packages and their versions required for your project, each on a separate line. For example:

```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```

4. Save the requirements.txt file.

Remember to update the requirements.txt file whenever you add or remove dependencies in your project.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
